  # As a visitor
  # When I visit the Parent Index page
  # Then I see a link to create a new Parent record, "New Parent"
  # When I click this link
  # Then I am taken to '/parents/new' where I  see a form for a new parent record
  # When I fill out the form with a new parent's attributes:
  # And I click the button "Create Parent" to submit the form
  # Then a `POST` request is sent to the '/parents' route,
  # a new parent record is created,
  # and I am redirected to the Parent Index page where I see the new Parent displayed.
